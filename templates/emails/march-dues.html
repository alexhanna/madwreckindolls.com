Hello {{ skater_short_name }},<br>
<br>
March dues payments are due on Saturday, March 2. 

{% if skater.balance > 0 %}
Your dues are <b>${{ skater.balance }}</b>.<br>
{% else %}
It doesn't appear that you owe any dues currently. (We have you in the "{{ skater.status.name }}" group.)<br>
{% endif %}
<br>

{% if skater.balance > 0 and skater.automatic_billing and skater.stripe_customer_id != "" %}
<b>You have automatic billing enabled. We will attempt to charge your card on 3/2 for your dues.</b><br>
<br>
{% endif %}

We have a new website for paying online and managing your account. It's very much a work in progress, please let us know if you have any issues.<br>
<br>
Here's how to access your account:<br>

<br>
<b>Email:</b> {{ skater.email }}<br>
<b>Password:</b> {{ new_password }}<br>
<br>
If chose not to pay online, you can pay Trueblood or The Auditor in person with cash, checks, or credit card. You can also mail a check to The Auditor. Additionally, is also a MWD mailbox located at The Auditor's, you can place an envelope with your name and payment (cash or check).<br>
